##Welcome to Tic Tac Toe

####How to play:

Tic Tac Toe (Noughts & Crosses / X's & O's) is a game for two players, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 by 3 grid.

How to beat you opponent? Just get a row, column or diagonal, and **VICTORY** is yours.


#####The approach taken:

I kept the CSS styling to a minimum, only using two colours, kept the game board clean with rounded edges and a solid one pixel border. The board scales well, is centered on the page and has a button which allows the players to restart the game whenever a game ends, or even during the game.

The JavaScript code has four functions, switchPlayer, checkForWinner, playerTurn and reset. Working out the logic was the easiest part, but it was a challenge trying to write these functions together, and to call them within one another. I did not want to over-complicate things and get ahead of myself, so I opted for a game which was simple and functional. As I am currently learning the in’s and outs of JavaScript, one day I would like to add animations to my X’s and O’s, a scoreboard and a computer opponent, but for now I am quite happy with the result. Thumbs up!
